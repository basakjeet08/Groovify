/**
 * Basic composable that enables users to edit text via hardware or software keyboard, but
 * provides no decorations like hint or placeholder.
 *
 * Whenever the user edits the text, [onValueChange] is called with the most up to date state
 * represented by [String] with which developer is expected to update their state.
 *
 * Unlike [TextFieldValue] overload, this composable does not let the developer to control
 * selection, cursor and text composition information. Please check [TextFieldValue] and
 * corresponding [BasicTextField] overload for more information.
 *
 * It is crucial that the value provided in the [onValueChange] is fed back into [BasicTextField] in
 * order to have the final state of the text being displayed.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * Please keep in mind that [onValueChange] is useful to be informed about the latest state of the
 * text input by users, however it is generally not recommended to modify the value that you get
 * via [onValueChange] callback. Any change to this value may result in a context reset and end
 * up with input session restart. Such a scenario would cause glitches in the UI or text input
 * experience for users.
 *
 * This composable provides basic text editing functionality, however does not include any
 * decorations such as borders, hints/placeholder. A design system based implementation such as
 * Material Design Filled text field is typically what is needed to cover most of the needs. This
 * composable is designed to be used when a custom implementation for different design system is
 * needed.
 *
 * For example, if you need to include a placeholder in your TextField, you can write a composable
 * using the decoration box like this:
 *
 * If you want to add decorations to your text field, such as icon or similar, and increase the
 * hit target area, use the decoration box:
 *
 * In order to create formatted text field, for example for entering a phone number or a social
 * security number, use a [visualTransformation] parameter. Below is the example of the text field
 * for entering a credit card number:
 *
 * @param value the input [String] text to be shown in the text field
 * @param onValueChange the callback that is triggered when the input service updates the text. An
 * updated text comes as a parameter of the callback
 * @param modifier optional [Modifier] for this text field.
 * @param enabled controls the enabled state of the [BasicTextField]. When `false`, the text
 * field will be neither editable nor focusable, the input of the text field will not be selectable
 * @param readOnly controls the editable state of the [BasicTextField]. When `true`, the text
 * field can not be modified, however, a user can focus it and copy text from it. Read-only text
 * fields are usually used to display pre-filled forms that user can not edit
 * @param keyboardOptions software keyboard options that contains configuration such as
 * [KeyboardType] and [ImeAction].
 * @param keyboardActions when the input service emits an IME action, the corresponding callback
 * is called. Note that this IME action may be different from what you specified in
 * [KeyboardOptions.imeAction].
 * @param singleLine when set to true, this text field becomes a single horizontally scrolling
 * text field instead of wrapping onto multiple lines. The keyboard will be informed to not show
 * the return key as the [ImeAction]. [maxLines] and [minLines] are ignored as both are
 * automatically set to 1.
 * @param maxLines the maximum height in terms of maximum number of visible lines. It is required
 * that 1 <= [minLines] <= [maxLines]. This parameter is ignored when [singleLine] is true.
 * @param minLines the minimum height in terms of minimum number of visible lines. It is required
 * that 1 <= [minLines] <= [maxLines]. This parameter is ignored when [singleLine] is true.
 * @param visualTransformation The visual transformation filter for changing the visual
 * representation of the input. By default no visual transformation is applied.
 * @param onTextLayout Callback that is executed when a new text layout is calculated. A
 * [TextLayoutResult] object that callback provides contains paragraph information, size of the
 * text, baselines and other details. The callback can be used to add additional decoration or
 * functionality to the text. For example, to draw a cursor or selection around the text.
 * @param interactionSource the [MutableInteractionSource] representing the stream of
 * [Interaction]s for this TextField. You can create and pass in your own remembered
 * [MutableInteractionSource] if you want to observe [Interaction]s and customize the
 * appearance / behavior of this TextField in different [Interaction]s.
 * @param decorationBox Composable lambda that allows to add decorations around text field, such
 * as icon, placeholder, helper messages or similar, and automatically increase the hit target area
 * of the text field. To allow you to control the placement of the inner text field relative to your
 * decorations, the text field implementation will pass in a framework-controlled composable
 * parameter "innerTextField" to the decorationBox lambda you provide. You must call
 * innerTextField exactly once.
